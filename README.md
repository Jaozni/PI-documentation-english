  Our Project, focused on social inclusion, required an application at the  Database, taking into account our audience, identities, relationships, and others.. To design our database, we used the Br.Modelo platform to develop the Conceptual Model and Logical Model, while     for coding, we used MySQL Workbench.
  For programming, we used Python to register students, mentors, courses, and other related information.
  Our design was developed with the goal of creating an inclusive interface for people with disabilities, creative, accessible, interactive, dynamic, and clean. Before thinking about the physical aspects, we focused on user-centered methodologies and empathy, such as the     methods:
  Design Thinking: A method divided into five stages, from identifying the problem to finding solutions. A design approach centered on empathy and user needs.
  Empathy Map: Helps to understand the frustrations and expectations of our users.
  Stakeholder Map: Identifies the audience, their relevance, and their interest in the project.
  Effort vs. Impact Matrix: Determines which stages of the project are priorities, and which are future ideas, discardable, or currently inaccessible.
  Double Diamond: A diagram that divides the project into four stages: the first two focus on divergence, encouraging opinions and broad ideas, and the last two focus on convergence, limiting ideas down to priorities and useful solutions.
